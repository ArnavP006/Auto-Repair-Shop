                            Most manufacturers recommend changing your oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles for conventional
                            oil, or every 10,000 to 15,000 miles for synthetic oil. However, this can vary based on your
                            driving habits and vehicle type. Check your owner's manual for specific recommendations, and
                            our technicians can help you determine the best schedule for your vehicle.

                            Yes! We stand behind our work with a comprehensive warranty. Most repairs come with a
                            12-month/12,000-mile warranty, whichever comes first. Specific warranty terms may vary
                            depending on the type of repair and parts used. We'll always discuss warranty coverage
                            before beginning any work.

                            Service times vary depending on the type of work needed. A basic oil change typically takes
                            30-45 minutes, while more complex repairs like brake replacement or transmission work may
                            take several hours or even a full day. We'll provide you with an estimated completion time

                            Common signs include squealing or grinding noises, vibration when braking, longer stopping
                            distances, or a brake warning light on your dashboard. If you notice any of these symptoms,
                            bring your vehicle in for a free brake inspection. We'll check your brake pads, rotors, and
                            fluid to determine what's needed.

                            this indicates a more serious issue - contact us immediately or have your vehicle towed.

                            We recommend following your vehicle manufacturer's maintenance schedule, typically every
                            5,000-10,000 km or every 6 months, whichever comes first. Regular maintenance includes oil
                            changes, tire rotations, brake inspections, and fluid checks. We'll create a personalized
                            maintenance schedule based on your vehicle and driving habits.
